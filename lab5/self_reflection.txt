You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Use for-each loop to iterate through the array, instead of using a get function.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I felt proud of the fact that I was able to implement the resize function without looking at the staff solution. I was able to figure out the logic of the resize function by myself.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I achieve equal function by using a for loop to iterate through the array. I think it is not very elegant because it is not very efficient.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: How to use for-each loop to iterate through the array.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Rebuild equal function.
